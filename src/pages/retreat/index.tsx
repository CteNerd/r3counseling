        <h1>Your Host</h1>
        <p>
          Hey Y’all, I‘m Tiffany. I am an ambitions woman juggling the roles of
          a devoted wife, a nurturing mother to three amazing kiddos, and a
          multipreneur. For years, I threw myself into caring for others, often
          neglecting my own well-being in the process. Despite my dedication, I
          began feeling drained, disconnected, and even resentful at times. I
          did not realize that you can not pour from an empty cup. On my journey
          to self-discovery and revitalization, holistic practices became
          transformative. Through movement, I found a way to reconnect with my
          body, create space for healing, and deepen my love for self. I
          explored and rediscovered my innate connection to the power of sound,
          meditation, and the usefulness for healing each layer of my being. Of
          course, as I intentionally moved towards embodiment of these
          practices, I naturally wanted to share their transformative power with
          others. Recognizing the power of PAUSE, intentionality, and embracing
          holistic healing, I am passionate about sharing this journey to guide
          others to their own path to rest, restore, and reclaim their
          wholeness, time, and self care.
