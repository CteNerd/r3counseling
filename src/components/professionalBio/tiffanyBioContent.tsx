            and I’m also known as The Cookie Counselor. Yep, I bake to release
            stress, ground myself, and enrich my creative sweets passion.<br /><br />
            My hobby turned small business,{" "}

            towards resources for my clients here – grounding tools and workshops.<br /><br />

            relatable, consistent and professional. I have had the privilege of
            serving in multiple clinical capacities throughout my career. I am
            passionate and committed to helping individuals heal from sexual trauma,
            explore traumatic experiences, anxiety, self-esteem, depression and
            grief.<br /><br />
            While being culturally humble, I incorporate Integrative and Holistic
            modalities, in a trauma informed and person-centered environment. During
            your journey, you deserve to be supported as you release, restore, and
            redefine!
