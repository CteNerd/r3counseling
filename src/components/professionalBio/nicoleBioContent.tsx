        Along my journey in becoming a therapist, one mantra has stuck 
with me throughout: “You are the expert of your life.” This mantra 
encompasses my main beliefs as a therapist— that clients are the
experts of their lived experiences. As your therapist, I hope to 
help you find agency and alignment with the truest version of 
yourself. Through mindfulness and intentionality, I hope to create 
a safe space to challenge, grow and maintain the values that can 
help you nurture your highest self.
While approaching therapy from a decolonizing and 
neurodivergent-affirming lens, I support clients towards radical 
healing from trauma, anxiety, and stress. I understand the 
struggles of navigating life in a world that was not designed to 
hold space for you. I believe in honoring and respecting your lived
experience while bringing awareness to the societal and systemic 
forces that affect your daily choices.
